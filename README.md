# Combinational-Multiplier-Hierarchical-Architectures
Designed a 2x24-bit combinational multiplier with four hierarchical architectures

Architecture #1: CSM_2B:

Designed components that use 2-bits of B per block

}  CSM_Block_2B

}  CSM_LastBlock_2B

Architecture #2: CSM_4B

Designed components that use 4-bits of B per block

}  CSM_Block_4B

}  CSM_LastBlock_4B

Architecture #3: CSM_6B

Designed components that use 6-bits of B per block

}  CSM_Block_6B

}  CSM_LastBlock_6B

Architecture #4: CSM_8B

Designed components that use 8-bits of B per block

}  CSM_Block_8B

}  CSM_LastBlock_8B

Used Matlab to create input/output test vector files for the design

Created a testbench with 4 configurations to test each architecture using your I/O files.

Tested the largest (positive) numbers in the range

Tested the smallest (negative) numbers in the range

Tested mixed inputs (positive and negative numbers)

Tested from both sides of zero

Tested the zero inputs

Created a schematic for each configuration using the DataFlow feature in ModelSim
