# Combinational-Multiplier-Hierarchical-Architectures
Designed a 2x24-bit combinational multiplier with four hierarchical architectures
Architecture #1: CSM_2B:

Designed components that use 2-bits of B per block

}  CSM_Block_2B

}  CSM_LastBlock_2B

Architecture #2: CSM_4B
Designed components that use 4-bits of B per block

}  CSM_Block_4B

}  CSM_LastBlock_4B

Architecture #3: CSM_6B
Designed components that use 6-bits of B per block

}  CSM_Block_6B

}  CSM_LastBlock_6B

Architecture #4: CSM_8B
Designed components that use 8-bits of B per block

}  CSM_Block_8B

}  CSM_LastBlock_8B

Useed Matlab to create input/output test vector files for the design

Createed a testbench with 4 configurations to test each architecture using your I/O files.

Test the largest (positive) numbers in the range

Test the smallest (negative) numbers in the range

Test mixed inputs (positive and negative numbers)

Test from both sides of zero

Test the zero inputs

Create a schematic for each configuration using the DataFlow feature in ModelSim
